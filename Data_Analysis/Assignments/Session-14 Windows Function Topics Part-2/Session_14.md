'''
  **Syntax**

    ' SELECT order_id, user_id, order_date, total_amount, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY order_date DESC ) AS user_order_seq FROM Orders; '

## 4.Imagine a table named Influencers with columns (id, platform, followers). Write an SQL query to display the top 3 influencers per platform using ROW_NUMBER(), showing id, platform, followers, and their row number.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use a subquery or CTE to filter for row numbers less than or equal to 3.</em>
'''
  **Syntax**

    ' SELECT id, platform, followers, rn FROM ( SELECT id, platform, followers, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( PARTITION BY platform ORDER BY followers DESC ) AS rn FROM Influencers ) AS ranked_influencers WHERE rn <= 3; '
